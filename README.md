# Algorithm Visualiser

> Learn popular algorithms by visualising every step of their execution

[Demo](https://louisjordan.co.uk/algorithm-visualiser)

[![Test Action Status](https://github.com/louisjordan/algorithm-visualiser/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/louisjordan/algorithm-visualiser/actions)

## Inspiration

Algorithm Visualiser was inspired by a number of awesome projects:

-   [algorithm-visualiser.org](https://algorithm-visualiser.org) ([GitHub](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer))
-   [vardbg](https://github.com/CCExtractor/vardbg) ([GitHub](https://github.com/CCExtractor/vardbg))
-   [visualgo](https://visualgo.net/)

They all offer a range of fantastic features, each with their own benefits and trade-offs. This project aims to bring together the best of all of these while avoiding some of the trade-offs they've made.

## Goals

-   Simple and intuitive UI that's accessible to novice programmers.
-   Clean code previews. Only see the code being executed, no unnecessary and messy comments.
-   Dynamic algorithm inputs. Let users change the inputs on the fly.
-   Straight-forward documentation. Explain algorithms in plain English making it easier for everyone to learn.
-   Streamlined development workflow. Make it easy for developers to contribute new algorithms and maintain existing ones.

## Contributing

This project is still in early development. Contributions will be accepted when APIs and components are stable.
